# Pizzaiolo Graphics

Graphics for the Pizzaiolo app, including iOS design, pizza illustrations and icons. They were created using Sketch 43, so make sure you have the same version or a higher one before opening the files.

## iOS

The iOS design is minimalistic and uses the platform's idioms as much as possible.

## Pizzas

As I found out, the internet is scarce of high quality, free to use photos of pizzas from above. At least, I found it difficult to find more than a handful of decent ones. So, I decided to design them myself so not only I'd be free to choose whatever pizza I wanted, but had some fun too.

These pizzas and their condiments are used throughout the app and in my opinion, have much more character than some generic photos.
